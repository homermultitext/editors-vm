The `editors-vm` repository defines a virtual machine including all the software necessary to edit and validate contributions to the Homer Multitext project.  All editors should use the tools in this VM to validate and verify their work.

Documentation is available at <http://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-docs/vm/>.


## Technical summary ##

The project uses [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to define a virtual machine you can run with  [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).  The current VM is a 64-bit machine using [elementary OS ](https://elementary.io/) for its operating system.
