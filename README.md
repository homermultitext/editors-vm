# vm2015

In this directory, the file `Vagrantfile` (along with accompanying scripts in the `system` and `scripts` directories) defines the virtual machine for HMT editorial work.  You should **not** edit or alter those files.

When you run the virtual machine, this directory will be shared between the VM and your host computer.  Feel free to add or modify other material here, either in the VM or in your host computer..

This version is the current devlopment version, planned for release in time for summer, 2016, research on HMT.


## Current status ##
