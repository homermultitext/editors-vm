# editors-vm

In this repository, the file `Vagrantfile`, along with accompanying scripts in the `system` and `scripts` directories, defines the virtual machine (VM) used by editors contributing to the Homer Multitext project (HMT).  You should **not** edit or alter those files.

When you run the virtual machine, this directory will be shared between the VM and your host computer.  Feel free to add or modify other material here, either in the VM or in your host computer.

This release of the HMT editors' virtual machine uses a free Linux operating system, [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/).

## Version

The `master` branch of this repository contains current development work on the VM to be used at the HMT summer seminar at the Center for Hellenic Studies in the summer of 2018.

## Notes for docs

Instructions for installing and using the HMT editors' VM are on line here:
